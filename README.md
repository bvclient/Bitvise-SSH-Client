## Introduction

Bitvise SSH Client is a professional-grade Windows SSH and SFTP solution designed for secure remote administration and reliable file transfer. It combines an SSH terminal, graphical SFTP interface, and advanced tunneling features in one lightweight package, making it suitable for both individual developers and enterprise IT teams. The client supports strong encryption, modern key exchange algorithms, and flexible authentication methods, including public key, password, and keyboard-interactive options, helping you meet strict security requirements.

With robust port forwarding capabilities (local, remote, and dynamic/SOCKS), Bitvise enables secure access to internal services without exposing them directly to the internet. Session profiles let you store connection parameters, keep settings consistent across environments, and quickly switch between servers. The integrated SFTP client offers fast, dependable transfers with resume support, directory synchronization, and convenient drag-and-drop workflows for daily operations.

Bitvise SSH Client is optimized for stability and performance, even over high-latency links, and provides detailed logging to assist troubleshooting and auditing. It integrates well into operational workflows through command-line options and automation-friendly behavior, allowing repeatable connections and scripted tasks. Whether you are managing Linux servers, maintaining cloud instances, or transferring sensitive configuration files, Bitvise SSH Client delivers a secure, efficient, and highly configurable experience for modern remote access needs.
